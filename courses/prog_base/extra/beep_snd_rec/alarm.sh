# FIXME - There is popping between notes.
# TODO? - A mono chiptune.
#   As I'm not a musician and simple searches have not come up with the "source" frequency/duration for each note for such music, I cannot produce anything easily.
# TODO? - A stereo chiptune.
#   It feels possible to essentially create two "threads", and control left and right speakers separately.
#   Hell, more speakers are probably also possible.
# TODO? - Experiment with multiple mono threads.  Can multiple instances of speaker-test exist and play overlapping notes simultaneously, simulating multiple channels?
