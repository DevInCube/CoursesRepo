The world had moved on since then
It was what the country required
Below the waterbag were his guns
He caught a glint in the shaving mirror
He shifted his weight from foot to foot
He vaguely remembered being angry
Evenings like this usually ended badly
Human beings are great adaptors
Then he took out his morning letters
There is little or no magic about them
We don't want any adventures here
It was not the correct thing to say
And he also happened to be a wizard
His eyes were itching with tiredness
Through the window soared three owls
There was an enormous jet of blood
Then she ran away down the sidewalk
There was nothing funny about this
These people are popping up everywhere
The smell of smoke was getting stronger
A recorded female voice followed
Please try your call again later
We built our robots all in one building
It's a mathematical impossibility
Then they were over clear sky again
The radical generalization offered it
The heat is turned into electricity
Rule 1 potential above everything
I guess someone will find it eventually
The storm had abated; I was facedown
