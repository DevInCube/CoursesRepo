But the space suits have to be portable
I now risked dying from oxygen toxicity
The air can escape through the valve
I pulled it out as fast as I could
Right that moment I knew I was screwed
A quick shot of local anesthetic
My flight spacesuit has a hole in it
He looked back at the snake and winked
As the snake slid swiftly past him
They also carried knobbly sticks
The goblin looked at it closely
He raised the wand above his head
His school books were very interesting
There were four sandwiches inside
He pulled one of them apart and said
He kept his eyes fixed on the door
Pearly-white and slightly transparent
Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes
But don't judge on what you see
You can keep your bowlers black
The ship landed in a medley of noises
His visa was inspected and stamped
The roof was almost lost in the heights
The man at the desk was speaking again
In the last millennium of the Empire
The rate of planetary turnings differed
There was no green to be seen; no green
It might be ten thousand miles away
Nine-tenths of it is out of sight
I thought you used atomic generators
